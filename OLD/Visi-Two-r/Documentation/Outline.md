Really liked the environmental interactions in Visitor the first. I want to build on that.

Really didn't like the tentacle control scheme, want to improve upon that.

Maintain the idea of being a prisoner trying to escape, keep wide variety of mooks, even if there are only a few kinds.

## Tools:
### Player
- Move
- Kick?
### Tentacle
- Pick origin point
	- Select tile on grid. Starts under you. Can use mouse or arrow keys to decide where to start from.
- Spike
	- Normal vertical attack, will stun enemies mostly. Kill innocents and basic ranged one hit, melee two hits.
	- can be used to detonate an object
- Shove Directional
	- Has an attack length, indicates how many cells are stunned as well as shoved
	- Enemies are shoved in a line until they either the tentacle is no longer occupied or there is nowhere else for people to be shoved to.
	- Shove is lethal if nowhere for them to go
- Throw Directional
	- Can be used to throw objects in a direction.
	- Stuns, doesn't damage enemies unless they hit something solid before landing. Won't shove enemies the same way, but can move things further overall based on weight.
	- Throwing explosives can trigger secret rooms.
- Teleport
	- Can't target self
	- Allows you to grab something, bring it near you.
- Delayed Trigger Mine action thing
	- Pick a cell, pick an action, pick a target. If something moves onto that point, a triggered action happens.
- Special Smash
	- Not defined yet, but basically it's gonna act as a special big boom thing. Maybe it detonates in an area, requires you to do a certain action to recharge it. Secret rooms should be infrequent to allow people to uncover them with their first or second charge.
- Most heavily inspired by Binding of Isaac
