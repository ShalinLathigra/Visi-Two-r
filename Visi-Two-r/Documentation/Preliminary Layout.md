So, how is this dang thing going to work?

## Gameplay loop is:
- Enter Encounter
- Clear Encounter
- Level up

## Goal for first iteration is to have:
- Plain room
- Player in the mix moving around
- Tentacle able to: 
	- Spike
	- Shove
	- Throw
- Other things:
	- Throwable crates
	- Explosive Throwable crates
	- Innocents (Light)
	- Melee enemies
	- Ranged enemies (Aim at a tile / set of tiles, if you're on it after your next move, you take damage)
	- Secret Rooms
- Hand made map system initially. Either room by room or have each floor be it's whole togethre thing.
